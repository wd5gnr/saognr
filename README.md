SAOGNR

For Supercon 2024 we threw down a challenge: bring your best SAO designs and – for a change – try to use I2C. While I’m not very artistic when it comes to board design, I decided I better set an example, and so SAOGNR was born.

What does it do? Well, it sends little messages via Morse code on a built-in speaker and on some intelligent LEDs. It draws power from the SAO connector on the host badge, or you can power it via USB C. In addition to sending little Morse code snippets, it can also act as an I2C peripheral so that a computer on the main badge can command it to send Morse code.
